<p>Dragon1 is an enterprise architecture software tool made by the Dragon1 Company (https://www.dragon1.com)</p>
<p>Anyone interested in enterprise architecture can learn what actually enterprise architecture is.</p>
<p>We will place 10 concepts and principles as patterns (in JSON, XML and Excel Sheet) here that can be used for discovery and modeling.</p>
<p>These concepts and principles can be selected and used to create yoir own architecture.</p>
<p>The first concept and principle will be ReUse.</p>
<p>Suppose your organization provides 20 different services to clients, how much reuse is their in the build blocks of these services?</p>
<p>And what opportunities for reuse are there?</p>
<br/>
<p>In the JSON, XML and Excel-Sheets folder you find files you can upload in the Dragon1 Viewer: https://www.dragon1.com/viewer.</p>
